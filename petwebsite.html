  <h>CANOPUS MY DOG</h>

  <img src="canopus .jpg" alt="photo of a dog">

  <P>They say that a dog is the best friend any humanbeing can get, well i dont get why someone would loathe a poor animal, and i agree. Canopus was a birthday present from my dad on my eighteenth birthday. I guess my dad knew aldulting is scam and wanted me to have a friend whom Icould lament to </P>  <p>Canopus  loves reflex meal, taking walks and playing around</p>
